-> What is API  : "An API, or Application Programming Interface, serves as a bridge that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. It defines the rules and protocols for how requests and data should be exchanged, enabling developers to access the functionality or data of one system from another. APIs are essential in modern software development, enabling the creation of powerful, integrated, and efficient solutions by providing a standardized way for different software components to work together seamlessly."
